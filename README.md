### Problem Statement

Trade experience includes information such as his/her  the loan amount taken by him/her, loan disbursed date, Date of  report when his information is reported in bureau and others information such as his payment dpd status and months.
DPD is days past due during his EMI duration. For example if a customer doesn’t repay his/her emi for more than 30 days after his given repayment date, then it is said that a customer has gone 30+dpd. 
The report has information about multiple trades according to the customer’s trade types (eg:-Business Loan, Personal Loan ,etc.)   , disbursed date, disbursed amount etc.
For each single trade you will have Disbursed Amount (loan amount) a customer has taken for that loan (eg-100000(Disbursed Amount)  for Business Loan(Account Type) on 01-06-2011(Disbursed date) and for each trade you will have his payment history of that particular loan that has his/her DPD value, status and month for which he has to pay back his EMI.
